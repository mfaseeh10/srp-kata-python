## What is SRP?

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that a class or module should have one and only one reason to change. This means that a class should have a single responsibility or purpose, which makes it easier to:
- Understand the code
- Maintain the system
- Avoid tightly coupled dependencies

## About This Kata

The SRP Kata is a hands-on exercise that helps developers recognize violations of SRP and refactor the code to align with this principle. The goal is to:

1. Identify multiple responsibilities within a single class.
2. Refactor the class by separating these responsibilities into smaller, more focused classes or modules.
3. Ensure the code remains functional and testable after the refactoring.

   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
   ```

3. **Run the Tests**
   Execute the existing test suite to ensure everything is working as expected before starting your refactor:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest FoodDeliverySystemTest.py
   ```
